## Projects

### Linear Regression | Bike Sharing System 

•	Examined key factors impacting shared bike demand to boost revenue and identified significant variables for predictive analysis.
•	Conducted data collection, preprocessing, and model training, evaluating performance using metrics like MSE, RMSE, and R-squared for accuracy and explanatory power assessment.

### Logistic Regression | Hot Leads identifying for Online Education Company

•	Identified top "Hot Leads" for an online education company by assigning lead scores, focusing on potential conversion chances.
•	Collected and preprocessed data related to potential leads, training a logistic regression model with subsequent performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

### PCA + Logistic Regression | Telecom Churn Prediction  

•	Identified high-churn-risk customers, pinpointing key indicators, and focused on retaining highly profitable customers.
•	Utilized PCA to reduce dimensionality while retaining maximum variance, creating uncorrelated principal components. Trained a logistic regression model on the reduced dataset with careful hyper parameter tuning for both PCA and logistic regression.

### Exploratory Data Analysis| Loan Approval based on Credit History 

•	Executed EDA to analyze data patterns and identify loan applicants capable of repayment, using machine learning models for loan approval predictions.
•	Uncovered key insights and patterns in the dataset through exploratory data analysis, utilizing Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
•	Implemented data preprocessing techniques, including managing missing values, outliers, exploring numerical and categorical features, and visualizing relationships through boxplots

### MySQL | RSVP Movies Analysis 

•	Extracted and analyzed data from a MySQL database containing RSVP movies information to draw meaningful insights from movies released in the past three years.
•	Utilized various MySQL concepts and techniques, such as basic queries, joins, aggregation, filtering, sorting, indexes, optimization, views, stored procedures, and functions.
